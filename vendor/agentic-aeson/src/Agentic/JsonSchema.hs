-- | Lowering the core's t'Schema' to the strict JSON Schema that providers'
-- structured outputs and strict tools accept.

-- The result is the core's 'Value', not aeson's, because order matters: a
-- model writes an object's fields in the order its schema lists them, and a
-- record's field order is part of its meaning (a setup comes before its
-- punchline). aeson would sort the keys. Render with 'renderJson'.
